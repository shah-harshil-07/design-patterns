# 🎨 Design Patterns in Java

This repository contains simple and well-structured examples of **all major design patterns in Java** — each implemented in its own package for clarity and ease of understanding.

## 🧠 Overview

Design patterns are proven solutions to common problems that arise during software development.  
This repository demonstrates **how each pattern works** using concise, real-world-inspired examples in plain Java.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

Each pattern is contained in its own folder under `src/`, with a `Main.java` class to demonstrate usage.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
   cd design-patterns/src

2. **Compile the desired pattern’s code**
    javac packageName/Main.java

3. **Run the compiled class**
    java packageName.Main

Example:
    cd Singleton/LazySingleton
    javac Main.java
    java LazySingleton.Main
